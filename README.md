## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

GitHub Pages serves static files, so you have flexibility in organizing your code. Choose the approach that works best for your project.

### File Organization Options

**Option 1: Single File** (Simplest)
```
index.html      - Everything in one file (HTML + CSS + JS)
```
- Pros: Dead simple, one file to manage, fastest initial load
- Cons: Can become large and harder to maintain

**Option 2: Separated Resources** (Better organization)
```
index.html      - Main HTML structure with game menu
styles.css      - All styles
games.js        - All game logic in one file
```
- Pros: Clean separation, easier to edit styles and code
- Cons: Still one large JS file with all games

**Option 3: Multiple Game Files** (Recommended for this project)
```
index.html              - Home/menu page
styles.css              - Shared styles
games/
  ├── balloons.html     - Balloon pop game
  ├── drawing.html      - Drawing board game
  ├── feeding.html      - Animal feeding game
  ├── piano.html        - Musical keyboard game
  ├── shapes.html       - Shape sorter game
  └── bubbles.html      - Bubble wrap game
shared/
  ├── common.js         - Shared utilities (Polish text, sound functions)
  └── common.css        - Shared styles (colors, animations)
```
- Pros: Each game is independent, easier to develop and test, better code organization
- Cons: Slightly more navigation between files, need to manage shared resources

**Option 4: Hybrid Approach** (Good balance)
```
index.html              - Home/menu page (inline CSS/JS)
balloon-pop.html        - Self-contained game file
drawing.html            - Self-contained game file
feeding.html            - Self-contained game file
piano.html              - Self-contained game file
shapes.html             - Self-contained game file
bubbles.html            - Self-contained game file
```
- Pros: Each game is completely standalone, copy Polish text constants into each file
- Cons: Some code duplication (Polish constants, utility functions)

### Recommended: Option 3 or 4

For this project, **Option 3 (Multiple Game Files)** or **Option 4 (Hybrid)** works best because:
- Each game can be developed independently
- Easier to test individual games
- Smaller files load faster
- Better organized codebase
- Each game is a separate URL (e.g., `games/balloons.html`)
- Easy navigation: each game has a "home" button linking back to `index.html`

### Navigation Pattern

With multiple files, navigation is simple:

```html
<!-- index.html - Game menu -->
<div class="game-menu">
  <a href="games/balloons.html" class="game-btn">🎈 Baloniki</a>
  <a href="games/drawing.html" class="game-btn">🎨 Rysowanie</a>
  <a href="games/feeding.html" class="game-btn">🐰 Karmienie</a>
  <!-- etc -->
</div>

<!-- games/balloons.html - Game page -->
<div class="game-header">
  <a href="../index.html" class="home-btn">🏠 Dom</a>
  <button class="sound-toggle">🔊 Dźwięk</button>
</div>
<div class="game-area">
  <!-- Balloon pop game content -->
</div>
```

### Shared Code Pattern

If using shared resources (Option 3):

```html
<!-- Each game includes shared resources -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../shared/common.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../styles.css">
<script src="../shared/common.js"></script>
<script>
  // Game-specific code here
  const BalloonGame = { /* ... */ };
</script>
```

## 🎨 Design Guidelines

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Bright, saturated colors (HSL: 100% saturation, 50-60% lightness)

## 🎨 AI-Generated Images

This project now includes support for AI-generated images to enhance the visual experience! Instead of using emojis and basic SVG graphics, games can use custom AI-generated artwork created with Google's Gemini API.

### Features

- **Toddler-Friendly Style**: All images are generated with a cute, cartoon sticker-like appearance
- **Transparent Backgrounds**: Automatic background removal for seamless integration
- **Dual Format**: Images saved as both PNG and WebP for optimal performance
- **Graceful Fallback**: Games automatically fall back to emojis if images aren't available yet
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Automated image generation workflow

### Image Categories

The project includes prompts for generating:

- **Animals** (6 images): Rabbit, dog, cat, bear, elephant, monkey - for the feeding game
- **Food Items** (16 images): Carrot, lettuce, wheat, bone, meat, fish, milk, honey, etc. - for the feeding game
- **Shapes** (6 images): Circle, square, triangle, star, heart, pentagon - for the shapes game
- **Balloons** (4+ images): Various balloon shapes and colors - for the balloon game
- **Backgrounds** (2+ images): Themed backgrounds for different games

### How to Generate Images

Images are generated using a Python script with the Gemini API. There are two ways to generate them:

#### Option 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended)

1. Add `GEMINI_API_KEY` to repository secrets (Settings → Secrets → Actions)
2. Go to Actions tab → "Generate AI Game Images"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select category (animals, food, shapes, balloons, backgrounds, or all)
5. Set delay between API calls (default: 2 seconds)
6. Images are automatically generated, optimized, and committed

#### Option 2: Local Generation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt

# Set API key
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Generate images
python scripts/generate_images.py --category animals
python scripts/generate_images.py --category food
python scripts/generate_images.py --category all
```

### Technical Details

- **Model**: gemini-2.5-flash-image (stable, current recommended model)
- **Background Removal**: Automatic using rembg library
- **Optimization**: Images resized to max 1024px dimension
- **Formats**: PNG (for compatibility) + WebP (for performance)
- **Storage**: `/images/{category}/{filename}.{ext}`

### Current Implementation Status

- ✅ **Feeding Game**: Fully implemented with AI images (animals + food items)
- ⏳ **Other Games**: Still using emojis/SVG (can be enhanced in the future)

The feeding game (`games/feeding.html`) automatically uses AI-generated images if available, and falls back to emojis if images haven't been generated yet.

### Cost & Licensing

- **Cost**: Free tier available with Gemini API (check current limits at ai.google.dev)
- **Licensing**: Generated images are subject to Google Gemini's terms of service
- **Estimated Usage**: ~50-70 images total for all games
